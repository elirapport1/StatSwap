# [StatSwap](https://elirapport1.github.io/StatSwap/)
is a daily matching game for basketball fans to test their player stat knowledge. 

I am a basketball fan and enjoy daily games like connections, so I wanted to make something combining the two that my friends would also like to play!

I used React with TypeScript as the core frontend framework, utilizing Vite for fast development and building. The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using @dnd-kit, while the backend leverages Supabase for database operations and Twilio for SMS notifications. The application integrates Axios combined with Cheerio for web scraping basketball statistics. The project employs CSS Modules for component-scoped styling and is deployed through GitHub Pages. The development workflow was enhanced with ESLint for code quality and GitHub Actions for automated daily stats updates and deployment.
