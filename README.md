# [StatSwap](https://elirapport1.github.io/StatSwap/)
is a daily matching game for basketball fans to test their player stat knowledge. 

I am a basketball fan and enjoy daily games like connections, so I wanted to make something combining the two that my friends would also like to play!

I used React with TypeScript as the core frontend framework, utilizing Vite for fast development and building. The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using @dnd-kit, while the backend leverages Supabase for database operations and Twilio for SMS notifications. The application integrates Axios combined with Cheerio for web scraping basketball statistics. I handled styling with component-scoped CSS-modules and deployed through GitHub Pages. The development workflow was enhanced with ESLint for code quality and GitHub Actions for automated daily stats updates and deployment.
