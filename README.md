# [StatSwap](https://elirapport1.github.io/StatSwap/)
is a daily matching game for basketball fans to test their player stat knowledge. 

I am a basketball fan and enjoy daily games like connections, so I wanted to make something combining the two that my friends would also like to play!

I used React with TypeScript as the core frontend framework, as well as vite. The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using @dnd-kit, and for backend db I used Supabase as well as Twilio for SMS notifications. To develop the player dataset I used Axios and Cheerio to scrape stats. And I used component-scoped CSS-modules for styling organization. Check it out and let me know what you think!
